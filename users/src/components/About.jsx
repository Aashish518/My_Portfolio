        <p>I am a self-motivated and enthusiastic MERN Stack Developer with a strong foundation in MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. As a fresher, I have built several real-world projects where I implemented modern web development practices and integrated advanced features using tools and npm modules. I have hands-on experience with React Router for routing, Context API and Redux for state management, and have designed responsive user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and modern UI libraries. Iâ€™ve successfully implemented Razorpay for secure payment integration, Nodemailer for email functionality, and Cloudinary with Multer for efficient image uploading. I regularly use Postman for API testing and Git/GitHub for version control. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and continuously strive to learn new technologies, take on new challenges, and build scalable, user-friendly web applications.</p>
