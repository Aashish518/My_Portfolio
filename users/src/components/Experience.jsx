          As a fresher, I may not have industry experience, but I have built several projects that reflect my practical knowledge and problem-solving skills. Each project in my portfolio is developed by me from scratch, using the MERN stack and modern tools. You can explore my work by clicking the buttons below to view live demos or source code, which showcase my ability to turn ideas into working web applications.
